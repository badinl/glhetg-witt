Fischeirs del möcts per la Glheþinaziun del Noveu Wittenberg.

If you don't understand what that means, this repo is probably not for you. But if you do, and you want to help, you're very welcome to.

You should probably check the Glheþ board on New Witt / Witt XIV for the SIGN guidelines on how to translate the strings (as soon as those guidelines exist).

Provisional guidelines (to be expanded):

- Use the provisional spelling
- Use "voi" forms
- If you're unsure on how to translate a word or set phrase, ask in the Wittenberg thread
